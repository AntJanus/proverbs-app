But in this case, the `body` of the `/api/user/13` request is required to have AT LEAST the keys present in `emptyMap`. If the comparison fails, the full path of the failure will be returned. For instance, if `body` was missing `image_url`, the error would read `Objects do not match at image_url`.\n\nWhat about deep objects? I use the [Treeize](https://www.npmjs.org/package/treeize) package in order to create deep object graphs. JSON-structure-validator works with that tool as well.\n\nLet's take our last example and extend the `emptyMap` to this:\n\n    var emptyMapSingle = {\n            \"name\" : \"\",\n            \"username\": \"\",\n            \"id\": \"\",\n            \"image_url\": \"\",\n            \"aliases\": [ {\n                \"alias\": \"\",\n                \"id\": \"\"\n            }]\n        };\n\n    var emptyMap = [];\n    emptyMap.push(emptyMapSingle);\n\nOur map would then match against the feed like so.\n\n**!important** Due to the \"minimal match\" feature of JSON-structure-validator, the object would be required to have AT LEAST ONE Alias. If there were multiple aliases, only the first one gets key match.\n\nWhat if you want an EXACT match as well as a minimal match?\n\n    var comparison = compareJSON(body, emptyMap);\n    var comparison2 = compareJSON(emptyMap, body);\n\nIn this case, the `emptyMap` will be required to have all of the keys present in `body`, meaning that any keys that are EXTRA in the body and are not present in our emptyMap will throw an error. Doing a backward match in `comparison2` will also ensure that any stray keys that are available in our emptyMap but are NOT in body (thus would not be matched against in the first comparison) would throw an error. That way we're covered both ways!\n",
